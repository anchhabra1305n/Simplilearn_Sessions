Every group will represent one object from our initial dataset. But it will have one additional categorical feature, a possible class value. Target values will be equal to 1 if the class value is equal to the correct class and 0 otherwise. Thus, each group will have exactly one 1 in labels and some zeros. You can put all possible class values in the group, or you can try setting only hard negatives if there are too many labels. We'll show this approach as an example of a binary classification problem."
